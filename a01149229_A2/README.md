VIS Assignment 2


The first thing I did was -> I grouped the same elements (duplicates) because it took a long time to load the map(lines and cirles). I group all elements by the "name".  For the last assignment with different lines I made different colors for female and male and this time for assignment 2 the lines colors are for number of crimes. Red is for more than 3 crimes in that city and the blue is for the less. 
For this assignment  Grade 4) I need to highlight cities and paths on mouseover. I did it with different color, in my example this color was green, because any other is not so much visible. For grade 3)Band Selection  I used a help from Stackoverflow, ( I wrote the source in code- I did not copy just used a idea because Band Selection was not cleary descripted. I hoped I did what you asked for. Its a range selection- I can select one or more than one city and also drag through the map. 
Wenn you click on the city that u want, you can read more information about it .
For Grade 2) I need to make addition table with different information and also pop up window.
In my example, wenn you click at the city the pop window shows up with the name of the city and button (more information). I was not sure what did you mean by Additional information table so I made : Wenn you click at the button on pop up window , you open the new html file (TABLE) with information about that city. And information are Total of arrestees and also how many are male and how many are female arrestees. 

quelle for assignment 2 that helped me (idea) :
